Human activity recognition, or HAR, involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data and traditionally involves deep domain expertise and methods from signal processing to correctly engineer features from the raw data in order to fit a machine learning model.

HAR plays an important role in inter-human interactions as it provides information about the identity, personality, psychology of a person. Activity recognition has a wide-ranging of applications like video surveillance systems, human-computer interaction, robotics etc.

Recently, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks have shown capable and even achieve state-of-the-art results by automatically learning features from the raw sensor data.
